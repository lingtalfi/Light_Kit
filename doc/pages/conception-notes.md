Dynamic variables
----------------
2019-05-15


The kit system distinguishes between static and dynamic variables.

Static variables are the ones stored directly in the page configuration.

And the dynamic variables are the ones created by php at runtime.

Static variables can reference dynamic variables by using a special notation, which defaults to the following:

- ${myVar}

(a dollar symbol, followed by an opening curly bracket, then the dynamic variable name, then the closing curly bracket)


Dynamic variables were create to solve the problem of a widget which needs to display "Hello Tim",
where "Tim" is the name of the currently logged user, and "Hello" is just one of many variations of a greeting word 
(could have been Hi, Bonjour, Salut, Guten Tag, Welcome,...).

Because of the number of potential variations of the greeting world ("Hello" in this case), it has to be stored in the 
widget configuration (and hence in the page configuration): the other approach would be to create one template by variation, 
but this would obviously lead us to too many template files, that's not a practical solution.

So thanks to the dynamic variable concept, we can store this in the widget configuration:

- Hello ${user_name}

Which solves the problem.
